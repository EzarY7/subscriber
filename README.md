**what is amqp?**
AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. AMQP is commonly used in message broker software such as RabbitMQ, which facilitates the exchange of messages between producers (senders) and consumers (receivers).

**what it means? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first quest, and what is
the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for? **
The first guest is the username used to authenticate with the message broker. The second guest is the password for the username used to authenticate with the message broker. localhost:5672 is the host and port where the AMQP broker is running.
